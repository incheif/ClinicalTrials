Women are at disproportionate risk for NASH, with approximately 15 million U.S. women affected. There is an urgent need to understand risk factors for NASH and its progression in women, and sex hormones may provide a missing link.\n\nThe investigator's preliminary data support a detrimental role of androgens, or \"male sex hormones\" on fatty liver in women but no studies have evaluated whether androgens are associated with liver inflammation and/or scarring from fatty liver (aka NASH). To better understand the mechanism by which androgens might promote NASH and/or metabolic co-factors that contribute to NASH, the investigators are conducting a pilot clinical trial to primarily assess the feasibility of using an androgen blocking medication, spironolactone, in women with NASH. Spironolactone was selected because it is has been commonly prescribed for decades with good safety profile and tolerability to treat symptoms of high androgens, like acne and hirsutism in young women. Though primarily a feasibility-focused study, the investigators also aim to explore the pathways by which blocking testosterone receptors might alter the biologic processes that promote NASH and its associated metabolic co-morbidities in women.","detailedDescription":"This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, (2:1) parallel group pilot clinical trial of spironolactone in women with biopsy-proven NASH receiving 6 or 12 months of spironolactone or placebo. 30 women are targeted for enrollment. Each participant will be administered a single dose of spironolactone or placebo once daily for a total of 6 or 12 months. In person evaluations will take place at Month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. There will be a telephone follow up visit within 3 months of end of treatment (up to Month 9 or 15).\n\nThis is a pilot clinical trial that is largely feasibility focused. Study outcomes will include\n\n* Change in liver stiffness on Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)\n* Change in hepatic steatosis by Magnetic Resonance Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF)\n* Change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n* Change in NASH histology as assessed by the continuous NAFLD activity score (NAS), which measures different components of NASH on liver biopsy.\n* Biochemical endpoints: serum lipids \\& HOMA-IR\n* Feasibility outcomes including Rates (and reasons) for the following: a) % women that decline/women contacted for study inclusion (i.e. need for a second liver biopsy, concern regarding randomization to placebo) b) % women enrolled/women screened (i.e. exclusion criteria too narrow), c) study dropout (i.e. medication side effects, too frequent study visits, and/or phlebotomy)"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"The following treatment regimens will be used:\n\n* Experimental treatment - spironolactone, 100 mg once daily\n* Placebo or Comparator - one capsule, once daily","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will not be known to investigators, research staff, or patients.

Despite this, the treatment options remain limited.

NASH is also recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Currently, weight loss is the only validated treatment for NASH and also positively affect all the features of metabolic syndrome. Considering the known positive metabolic effects of bariatric surgery, efforts have been exerted to develop minimally endoscopic procedures aiming to induce weight loss. Therefore, we would like to evaluate in patients with NASH disease and fibrosis, the impact of an endoscopic sutured gastroplasty (with Endomina® device) on:\n\n* Mainly liver histological endpoints but also,\n* Surrogate markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and\n* Surrogate markers of insulin resistance as well as fasting lipid and glycemic profiles.","detailedDescription":"Background and Rationale: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic and progressive disease which can evolve to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer and is associated to a higher risk of death related mainly to cardiovascular events. Weight loss affects positively histological and metabolic features of NASH. Similarly, bariatric surgery improves NASH and fibrosis in morbidly obese patients. New medical devices have been developed to perform endoscopic sutured gastroplasty (ESG) in obese patients. Those affected with coexisting NASH might constitute a good indication for such procedure.\n\nObjective: To determine whether ESG improves liver histology, defined as resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis at 48 weeks (primary outcome) after ESG.\n\nDesign, setting and participants: The ENDONASH trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled, European multicenter study with centrally blinded assessment of the primary outcome. Biopsy proven NASH patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either ESG associated to lifestyle intervention (LSI) or LSI alone using a computer-generated, centrally administered allocation, stratified by diabetes status, gender and fibrosis stage. Main inclusion criteria are: biopsy-proven NASH (i.e. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Score ≥4), fibrosis stage ≥1, BMI between 27-40, controlled type 2 diabetes.\n\nSample size calculation: The study is powered to establish a 50% response rate of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the ESG group and a 10% response rate in the control group (according to our previous study1 and a study2 which has evaluated the impact of weight loss on NASH). Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 (bilateral), a beta risk of 0.2 and a loss rate of 20%, a sample size of 100 patients is needed to achieve statistical significance. Analysis will be carried out by intention-to-treat analysis, which includes all patients who will undergo end-of treatment liver biopsy.\n\nProcedures: Eligible patients will be allocated to one arm of the study by means of an online platform (ViedocTM). Demographics, anthropometric measurements, medical history, blood samples and transient elastography will be performed at baseline and at different time points after the randomization during the 48 weeks of follow-up. Finally, all patients will undergo an end-of treatment liver biopsy 48 weeks after randomization.\n\nConclusion: The expected conclusion will allow to demonstrate if ESG, as an add on to LSI, may increases the number of patients with resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis at one year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Arm 1: Endomina procedure + lifestyle intervention Arm 2: Lifestyle intervention","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"The primary outcome will be blindly assessed at one year"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Endomina procedure + lifestyle intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The procedure will be performed under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation.

PURPOSE/SPECIFIC AIMS To determine the role of pioglitazone in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients with glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). NASH is a disease characterized by elevated plasma aminotransferases and histopathological changes in liver characterized by hepatocellular steatosis, chronic inflammation and fibrosis (1-3). Pioglitazone, a new thiazolidinedione (TZD), has proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (4). NASH affects \\~10-20% of obese and type 2 diabetic subjects (1-3, 5, 6). While the pathogenesis of NASH is poorly understood, there is consensus that insulin resistance and its associated abnormalities in lipid metabolism play a key role in the development of liver fat accumulation, and TNF-alpha is a major mediator in the progression of liver damage (7-9). Currently, there is no satisfactory therapy for NASH.\n\nPioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in patients with T2DM (4, 10-12), but the mechanism of action of TZDs is unclear (13, 14). Pioglitazone activates genes involved in lipid synthesis, causing a reduction in plasma free fatty acid (FFA) and triglycerides (15). TZDs decrease excessive triglyceride accumulation in liver (16), muscle (17), and visceral fat (11, 16, 18), with a redistribution of fat to subcutaneous adipose stores (14). TZDs also antagonize the metabolic effects of TNF-alpha (19-22). Because pioglitazone ameliorates insulin resistance, reverses the metabolic abnormalities that contribute to hepatic fat infiltration (increased plasma glucose, FFA, and triglyceride concentrations), and antagonizes the effects of TNF-alpha, it follows that pioglitazone may prove useful for the treatment of patients with NASH.\n\nIn order to evaluate this hypothesis, we plan to treat for 6 months a group of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or T2DM with pioglitazone in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Three major endpoints will be measured before and after treatment (see Methods for a detailed description):\n\n1. Liver histologic response; assessed by liver biopsy. Steatosis and inflammatory changes will be quantified using a standardized staging system.\n2. Liver fat content: measured by liver magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\n3. Hepatic insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism: Because fat infiltration of liver and muscle causes insulin resistance and impairs glucose tolerance, we will measure parameters of metabolic control including fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids, fructosamine, HbA1c and fasting lipid profile. To assess the effect of pioglitazone on hepatic insulin sensitivity, fasting (basal) and postprandial hepatic glucose production will be studied using a double-tracer technique (infusion of 3-3H glucose combined with an oral glucose load radiolabeled with 1-14C glucose) (23). Glucose and lipid oxidation will be measured by indirect calorimetry (24). In addition, an index of hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity will be derived from the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (25)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"],"keywords":["NASH, IGT, T2DM"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":55,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Pioglitazone","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Pioglitazone 30 mg/d will be given for 8 weeks and titrated to 45 mg/d until the end of the 6-month study in a randomized, double-blind, study design.","interventionNames":["Drug: Pioglitazone"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo once daily is given following a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pioglitazone","description":"30 mg/d for 8 weeks and titrated to 45 mg/d until completing 6 months of treatment.","armGroupLabels":["Pioglitazone"],"otherNames":["Actos (Takeda Pharmaceuticals)."]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo is given to match pioglitazone.","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Liver histology (Kleiner criteria, Hepatology 2005)","timeFrame":"6 months."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Liver fat content by MRS.","timeFrame":"6 months."},{"measure":"Double-tracer OGTT (EGP, glucose clearance).","timeFrame":"6 months."}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

The causes are known to be associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance type 2 diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Histologically, it is characterized by steatosis, hepatocellular injury, and inflammation and fibrosis of the liver parenchyma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) may develop even in patients without viral hepatitis, therefore there have been much interest and many researches in causation and diagnosis for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH).\n\nLiver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD) and is the only reliable method for differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH) from simple steatosis. However, liver biopsy has several drawbacks, including invasiveness, potential complications such as excessive bleeding and death, sampling error, and inter- and intra-observer variability.\n\nMagnetic resonance(MR) imaging has been used as a multiparametric imaging tool with which to evaluate steatosis by chemical shift imaging andm magnetic resonance(MR) spectroscopy, and fibrosis by magnetic resonance(MR) elastography and T1 mapping. To the best of our knowledge, there is no accurate imaging diagnostic tool for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH), therefore the investigators aimed to develop non-invasive imaging diagnostic model using multiparametric magnetic resonance imager(MRI)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"],"keywords":["Magnetic resonance imager(MRI)","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD)","Imaging diagnostic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":47,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Imaging diagnostic and biopsy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"47 subjects who are suspected NASH from June 2016 to December 2017.","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Imaging diagnostic and biopsy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Imaging diagnostic and biopsy","description":"Liver biopsy and MRI scan","armGroupLabels":["Imaging diagnostic and biopsy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Radiologic Diagnosis & Criteria of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis(NASH)","description":"Development of non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic model for NASH using linear regression analysis\n\n1.

NAS is a summation of the histology scores for fat (0-3), inflammation (0-3), and ballooning (0-2) with a score of 4 or 5 or higher regarded as NASH. Whilst the score doesn't include fibrosis, the rapidly evolving clinical trials landscape in NASH has seen a shift in emphasis from drugs proposed to target liver fat to the targeting of fibrosis. This was due to observations contrary to the previously held belief that fibrosis could not improve, and the data to support fibrosis being predictive of clinical outcomes. As a result, many clinical trials now require patients to have a NAS ≥4 or 5, with the regulatory accepted criteria requirement for at least a score of 1 for inflammation and 1 for ballooning, and evidence of fibrosis of stage 2 or more (scored using the Kleiner-Brunt (0-4) scale). The route by which a liver biopsy is indicated for inclusion to a clinical trial is usually based on patient presentation and clinical work-up. In the Primary care patient presents with clinical risk factors for NASH like metabolic syndrome. Blood biomarkers will be checked and if raised patient will be referred to the hepatology. In the secondary care patient might have a transient elastography and if CAP is equal or more than 280 and LSM is equal or more than 7 kPa, patient will have biopsy.\n\nHowever clinical risk factors are often not sensitive enough, and NASH trials often suffer from high levels of screen fails at biopsy, meaning a large proportion are unnecessarily biopsied. Screening strategies are becoming increasingly more popular in order to reduce the number that fail screening and metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as T1-mapping and PDFF are emerging as promising diagnostic screening biomarkers in NASH.\n\nMRI exploits the magnetic properties of hydrogen nuclei protons within a determined magnetic field. T1 mapping measures longitudinal relaxation time, a measure of how long it takes for protons to re-equilibrate their spins to the magnetic field after being excited by a radiofrequency pulse, and thus is an indicator of regional tissue water (proton) content. T1 mapping has shown promise as an effective biomarker of liver inflammation and fibrosis, as T1 relaxation time lengthens with increases in extracellular fluid (which may be caused by fibrosis and/or inflammation). The presence of iron however, which can be accurately measured from MRI-T2star (T2\\*) relaxation time, shortens the T1, and thus must be accounted for. An algorithm has been created (Perspectum Diagnostics) that allows for the bias introduced by elevated iron to be removed from the T1 measurements, yielding the iron corrected T1 (cT1). Iron corrected T1 (cT1) has been shown to correlate with fibro-inflammatory disease and can effectively stratify patients with NASH and cirrhosis (7).\n\nMRI-PDFF is a ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the fraction of the MRI-visible protons attributable to fat divided by all MRI-visible protons in that region of the liver attributable to fat and water. Taking advantage of the chemical shift between fat and water, pulse sequences including fast spin echo and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequences can be used to acquire images at multiple echo times at which fat and water signals have different phases relative to each other. PDFF has been shown to have excellent correlation between histologically graded steatosis across the clinical range seen in NASH and high diagnostic accuracy in stratification of all grades of liver steatosis, although it is weaker in the presence of advanced fibrosis. Whilst PDFF does not correlate with other features of NASH, it has been reported that NAFLD patients with grade one steatosis are more likely to have characteristics of advanced liver disease such as fibrosis and ballooning, and changes in hepatic steatosis may be correlated with changes in other histological endpoints. Thus whilst some authors advise caution about using PDFF as a biomarker of NASH it has been well accepted by the NASH community as a biomarker for both enrolment and as an endpoint in NASH clinical trials (e.g. MOZART: NCT01766713; FLINT: NCT01265498).\n\nWhere cT1 appears to have an advantage over PDFF as a non-invasive biomarker for NASH, is in detection of patients with both disease activity (ballooning and inflammation) and fibrosis as cT1 has been reported to be correlated with ballooning, fibrosis and NAFLD activity score, and has been shown to predict clinical outcomes. As such it is emerging as a promising biomarker for both screening and as an endpoint in NASH clinical trials (NCT02421094; NCT02912260) particularly those investigating mechanisms of action of fibro-inflammation, or for distinguishing those with more advanced NASH with fibrosis. Both cT1 and PDFF can be acquired as part of the LiverMultiScan™ (LMS) imaging protocol (Perspectum Diagnostics Ltd, UK).\n\nBased on the data reported in the literature, and from our preliminary analysis of N=109 biopsy-confirmed NAFL patients recruited from the two UK studies, both cT1 and PDFF appear to have potential to become diagnostic biomarkers, that may have utility for clinical trial population enrichment when used in conjunction with clinical risk factors. Specifically, for PDFF to identify participants who are more likely to have histopathologic findings of steatosis, and cT1 to identify participants who are more likely to have histopathologic findings of NASH, and NASH with fibrosis.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate cT1 (Corrected T1) as a diagnostic biomarker that can be used, in conjunction with clinical risk factors, to identify patients who are more likely to have liver histopathologic findings of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Ideally, this biomarker should identify patients with a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) ≥ 4 and liver fibrosis (NASH/CRN Brunt/Kleiner scale) ≥ stage 2 on histopathologic assessment.\n\nBased on our observations from earlier trials, our hypothesis is that we expect cT1 to have good diagnostic accuracy for discriminating those with NAS≥4 \\& F≥2 from those without"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":225,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study-gate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Single arm of biopsy naïve participants suspected of having NAFLD or NASH, who have been referred for a liver biopsy as part of routine clinical care","interventionNames":["Diagnostic Test: Liver Multi Scan"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Liver Multi Scan","description":"MRI to create cT1, T2\\* and PDFF images of patients liver.","armGroupLabels":["Study-gate"],"otherNames":["Biopsy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Diagnostic performance of cT1","description":"To evaluate, in patients with suspected Nash referred for Liver biopsy, the diagnostic performance of cT1 at discriminating those patients with NAS≥4 \\& F≥2 from those patients without.

Fatty liver is generally diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound frequently as an incidental finding. Major risk factors for NAFLD include central (or abdominal) obesity, diabetes, elevated lipids, and metabolic syndrome.\n\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are those patients where the presence of fat in the liver is accompanied by an inflammatory process that can cause progressive fibrosis in the liver. Which can ultimately lead to end stage liver disease (i.e., cirrhosis) and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation. The 1990's was the decade of hepatitis C-related cirrhosis requiring transplantation. NASH is found in 3-5% of the population and is a subset of those patients with fatty liver.\n\nAminoaminoalanine Transaminase (ALT) is the liver enzyme measured in the blood that is a surrogate marker for inflammation and is frequently elevated in patients with NASH. Normalization of ALT is the ultimate treatment goal; however reduction in ALT is of significant clinical benefit.\n\nCurrently, the only treatment modality for patients with fatty liver disease is weight loss and exercise which is challenging for most patients. Therefore, a huge need exists for an alternative approach to reducing ALT levels for these patients.\n\nLow level laser light therapy (LLLT) offers a simple, non-invasive, safe, effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving this goal, through LLLT's proven ability to effect weight loss, body circumference reduction and inflammation reduction.\n\nApplication of the Erchonia® Verjú™ (green diode) Laser and Erchonia 635nm (red light) lasers to the body mid-region has been proven through controlled clinical trials to reduce body circumference in these areas in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner and to effect a decrease in overall body weight, both associated with reducing in ALT levels for the management of NASH patients. The Erchonia® EVRL Laser violet diode has been proven in controlled clinical trials to additionally effect inflammation reduction, another factor important in the management of NASH patients. Additionally, the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) identifies the Erchonia 532nm (green diode) and 635nm (red diode) lasers under Product Code OLI as: \"A Low Level Laser System for Aesthetic Use is a device using low level laser energy for the disruption of adipocyte cells within the fat layer for the release of fat and lipids from these cells for non-invasive aesthetic use.\"\n\nTherefore, it is hypothesized that treatment application with the Erchonia LLLT devices will effect a reduction in body circumference, weight and inflammatory factors significant enough to effect a clinically meaningful decrease in ALT levels in NASH patients in a safe and timely manner.\n\nThe biochemical effect of Erchonia® low level laser light therapy devices stimulates the mitochondria of the adipocyte cells which in turn increases the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The newly synthesized ATP triggers the up-regulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP has been shown to stimulate cytoplasmic lipase, triggering the conversion of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol that can easily pass through the cell membrane. The transitory pore is evidence that the laser is allowing for the movement of fatty acids, glycerol, and triglycerides to pass across the membrane and into extra-cellular space. Through vasodilation of nearby blood vessels and arteries, oxidization of the triglycerides and fatty acids occurs within the extra-cellular space. Additionally, LLLT is known to influence the receptors on the membrane of the cell and on the membrane of the cell's mitochondrion, eventually reaching the cell's DNA, which directly controls cell function. When cells function better, so do tissues, and as such, LLLT promotes inflammation reduction and the consequent healing and regeneration of damaged tissues.\n\nLLLT has been found to alter gene expression, cellular proliferation, intra-cellular (potential of hydrogen) phosphorus (pH) balance, mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of transient reactive oxygen species and calcium ion level, proton gradient and cellular oxygen consumption. With laser light able to induce cellular modulation, it has been proposed that LLLT may be able to serve as a subtle, non-invasive instrument in the reduction of clinical levels such as serum cholesterol levels, wherein it is proposed that laser therapy may suppress cholesterogenesis by altering the transcription factors responsible for the expression of essential genes involved in the biosynthetic process.\n\nRecent studies have already identified the modulation of transcription factors subsequent to laser irradiation. Jackson and coworkers (2002) have identified more than twenty transcription factors that are regulated by the intracellular redox state. In a pilot study, Erchonia observed that low-level laser application 3 times per week for two weeks reduced cholesterol levels, and even more importantly, reduced LDL levels while preserving HDL levels. It is proposed that laser therapy, by means of altering the intracellular redox state, can affect the function of transcription factors tightly associated with cholesterol synthesis.\n\nMoreover, laser therapy has been proven via multiple investigational studies to emulsify adipose tissue liberating all adipocyte stored fatty debris, demonstrated clinically through the observance of circumference reduction following LLLT administration. It is theorized that the liberation of fat is absorbed via the lymphatic system where lipolysis occurs in the lymph nodes and fatty-acid oxidation occurs in the liver. The mobilization of the fatty debris and production of ketone bodies may have an effect on applicable clinical lab markers.\n\nTherefore, the Erchonia Lasers are proven to be efficacious in effecting weight loss, circumference reduction, reduction of inflammation and improvement in clinical levels, all of which are factors that both directly and indirectly impact the reduction of ALT levels and improvement in the overall condition of NASH in affected individuals."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":0,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Erchonia Verju and EVRL Laser","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The Erchonia Verju Laser has 6 diodes that each emit 17 milliwatts (mW) 532 nanometers (nm) of green laser light.\n\nThe Erchonia EVRL Laser emits 635 nanometers (nm) red light and 405 nm blue light simultaneously","interventionNames":["Device: Erchonia Verju Laser","Device: Erchonia EVRL Laser"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Erchonia Verju Laser","description":"The Erchonia Verju Laser is applied 2 times a week to the front and back of the waist, hips and upper abdomen for 30 minutes each time over 8 to 12 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Erchonia Verju and EVRL Laser"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Erchonia EVRL Laser","description":"The Erchonia EVRL Laser is applied under the right ribcage angled towards the liver for 10 minutes, one time per week over the same 8 to 12 weeks as the Verju Laser is administered.","armGroupLabels":["Erchonia Verju and EVRL Laser"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percent (%) change from Baseline to Subject Study Endpoint evaluation in aminoalanine transaminase (ALT) level.","timeFrame":"2 or 3 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Review of subject's pre-existing medical records to confirm the current diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) according to the following criteria:\n\n  * ALT elevated on two separate determinations\n  * Abdominal ultrasound showing fatty liver\n  * Blood work that excludes other potential etiologies of liver disease\n* Subject has been on a stable diet and exercise regimen for NASH within the prior 6 months\n* Subject agrees to maintain his or her current diet and exercise regimen throughout study participation\n* Subject agrees to abstain from participating in any new treatments for NASH, other than the study treatments, throughout the course of study participation\n* Elevated aminoalanine transaminase (ALT) level, defined as 20 or more Unites/Liter (U/L) above the normal gender-specific ALT levels: males: ALT ≥ 60 U/L;

NAFLD is a spectrum of liver disease including (i) simple hepatic steatosis also called Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver (NAFL) and (ii) Non-alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH).\n\nWhen more than 5% hepatic steatosis is present, patients are considered to have NAFL. If steatosis is present along with hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation, patients are considered to have NASH. About 20% of patients with NAFLD have NASH.\n\nOver time, NAFLD may progress to cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a greater proportion of NASH patients (20%).\n\nPlatelets are specialized blood cells that continuously monitor and preserve the integrity of the cardiovascular system. Beyond their well-established role in hemostasis, platelets have been recently shown to actively participate in the inflammatory response and in tissue remodeling, by releasing bioactive molecules and by interacting with leukocytes.\n\nThe liver-platelet relationship is very complex. In physiological conditions the liver regulates platelet number by producing thrombopoietin and platelet lifespan by clearing aged platelets. In pathological conditions, increasing evidence demonstrate that platelets have an important role in regulating liver inflammation and chronic disease. Platelet-derived cytokines, such as TGF-β, platelet-derived growth factor-β (PDGF-β), and CXCL4, promote hepatic fibrosis, and platelet count has been used for many years as a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis (FIB-4 index). Recent studies demonstrate that platelet number and platelet aggregation are increased in liver sinusoids of NASH patients. Mechanistic insights provided by mouse models suggest that the role of platelets in NAFLD progression is mediated through the interaction with immune cells. Platelet colonization of the liver is mediated through the interaction with specialized macrophages lining the liver sinusoids (Kupffer cells) and it is a critical step for the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and NKT cells, which drive NASH progression through the release of cytokines and the metabolic reprogramming of hepatocytes. The importance of platelets in the development of NASH and subsequent progression to cirrhosis and HCC has been confirmed in humans by inhibiting platelets with a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel in a small pilot case study.\n\nThere is mounting evidence suggesting that distinct signaling pathways regulate the hemostatic and the inflammatory function of platelets. For instance, the platelet ITAM- (GPVI, CLEC2) and ITIM- (PECAM-1, TLT-1) coupled receptors regulate the platelet inflammatory response but have a minor role in hemostasis. Thus, one could envisage targeting the platelet inflammatory response as a strategy to limit the progression of NAFLD, without undermining hemostasis.\n\nHypotheses The overarching hypothesis of the proposed project is that platelets amplify the inflammatory state that drives the progression from NAFL to NASH.\n\nPlatelets participate in the inflammatory response by releasing bioactive compounds and establishing heterotypic interactions with leukocytes. However, these mechanisms in the context of chronic liver disease are poorly understood and have been studied mainly in mice.\n\nOur working model is that platelets docked in the liver of NAFLD patients amplify the inflammatory state by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn recruit and activate leukocytes in the liver sinusoids. Combined stimuli from leukocytes and platelets would then lead to metabolic reprogramming of hepatocytes and progression to NASH. In this context the investigators expect to identify an important role of GPVI and CLEC-2 and their inhibitory counterparts PECAM-1 and TLT-1, which are critically implicated in the regulation of platelet activation at sites of inflammation.\n\nThe investigators anticipate that features of the platelet inflammatory response could be both sensitive and sex-specific biomarkers for NASH progression and novel therapeutic targets."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis","NAFLD"],"keywords":["platelets","inflammation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"CROSS_SECTIONAL"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"Venous Blood will be centrifuged within 2 hours and plasma and serum samples will be stored at -80°C for further analysis."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":44,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NASH GROUP","description":"Recruited (n=22) patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.","interventionNames":["Other: High fat meal in a subset of patients with NAFL or NASH"]},{"label":"NAFL GROUP","description":"Recruited (n=22) patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver.","interventionNames":["Other: High fat meal in a subset of patients with NAFL or NASH"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"High fat meal in a subset of patients with NAFL or NASH","description":"In a subset of NAFL (n=11) and NASH (n=11) patients venous blood samples will also be taken 2 (T0+2h), 4 (T0+4h) and 6 (T0+6h) hours after consumption of a high fat meal.","armGroupLabels":["NAFL GROUP","NASH GROUP"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Concentration of platelet-leukocyte aggregates (evaluated as median fluorescence intensity -MFI- of platelets bound to leukocytes) in whole blood in patients with NAFLD and NASH","description":"Platelet leukocyte aggregates are a sensitive surrogate marker of platelet activation.

Successful pharmacological interventions to treat or prevent NASH are not available and so far only weight loss has clear benefits, but sustained weight-loss is difficult to achieve on the longer-term. We recently demonstrated in mice that plant sterol and stanol ester consumption inhibited the development of liver inflammation. Moreover, Javanmardi and co-workers recently observed reduced plasma concentrations of Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transaminase (AST) after daily plant sterol consumption (1.6 g/d) for 6 weeks in a population of adult NAFLD patients. In the current study, we propose to evaluate the effect of long-term consuming plant sterol or plant stanol esters on ALT concentrations in subjects who are at risk to develop NASH. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate the effect of plant sterol and plant stanol consumption on other parameters reflecting liver health, such as cathepsin-D, liver fat and liver insulin sensitivity.\n\nObjective: To assess the effect of consuming plant sterol or plant stanol esters (3 grams/day) for 6 months on ALT concentrations in subjects with elevated ALT concentrations, i.e. who are at risk to develop NASH.\n\nStudy design: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded pilot study with a run-period of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 6 months and a wash-out period of 1 month.\n\nStudy population: 90 subjects with elevated ALT concentrations (\\>ULN), aged 18-75 years.\n\nIntervention: All subjects will start a run-in period of two weeks during which they consume daily 20 grams of control margarine after which they will be randomly allocated to consume 20 grams control margarine or plant sterol or plant stanol enriched margarine on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome parameter in this study is the change in plasma ALT concentration.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: During a screening visit, body weight, body height and blood pressure are determined and a blood sample (5.5 mL) will be drawn. During the run-in period of two weeks, subjects will receive 20g control margarine and during the intervention period of 6 months they will be randomized to receive control, plant sterol ester or plant stanol ester margarine. On 7 occasions a fasting blood sample will be drawn (with a total of 195 mL) and at baseline and in week 26, samples for VOCs analysis will be taken, a FibroScan will be performed to measure liver fat and liver stiffness, body composition will be determined and retinal images will be taken. In a subgroup of 30 subjects, a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (278 mL blood sample) including a ventilated hood measurement for indirect calorimetry will be performed and liver fat and liver inflammation will be measured with MRS imaging at baseline and at the of intervention in week 26. All subjects will be asked to fill out a food frequency questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire two times and to keep a diary throughout the study and body weight and blood pressure will be assessed on five occasions.\n\nVenipuncture and insertion of a cannula can cause discomfort and possibly a local haematoma or bruise. Indirect calorimetry might evoke claustrophobic reactions, but there are no physical risks involved. MRS and MRI are modern diagnostic tools that do not imply significant risks (no ionizing radiation). In principle, all measurements are routine in our metabolic research unit (MRUM) and are not expected to lead to physical side effects. Total time investment spread-out over the study participation will be approximately 7 hours or 34 hours (depending on the subgroup), excluding travel time. Plant sterol and plant stanol enriched products are commercially available and we therefore do not foresee any risks related to the consumption of these food products"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"],"keywords":["Liver inflammation","Plant sterols","Plant stanols"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded study with a run-period of 2 weeks, an intervention period of 6 months and a wash-out period of 1 month.","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Colour-coded margarin tubs","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":8,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Plant sterol enriched margarine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"20 grams plant sterol enriched margarine on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Margarine"]},{"label":"Plant stanol enriched margarine","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"20 grams plant stanol enriched margarine on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Margarine"]},{"label":"Control margarine","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"20 grams control margarine on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Margarine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Margarine","description":"Intake of margarine","armGroupLabels":["Control margarine","Plant stanol enriched margarine","Plant sterol enriched margarine"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Liver inflammation","description":"ALT levels","timeFrame":"6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Glucose metabolism","description":"Insulin sensitivity using a 2-step clamp","timeFrame":"6 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

It can be hypothesized that colesevelam would lead to a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity and lipid profile compared with placebo and may lead to greater improvement in liver fat by MRI as compared to placebo.\n\nIn this pilot study, we propose to randomize approximately 55 patients (1:1 ratio) to either colesevelam or placebo and treat them for 24-weeks to evaluate changes in baseline insulin sensitivity, serum biochemistry (ALT and AST), and liver fat by MRI during therapy. Liver histologic changes would also be examined as an exploratory outcome for future studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"],"keywords":["NASH","NAFLD","Steatohepatitis","Nonalcoholic","Fatty Liver Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":59,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Placebo (sugar) pill","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Six tablets per day (identical to colesevelam)","interventionNames":["Drug: Colesevelam Hcl"]},{"label":"Colesevelam arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"3.75 grams per day","interventionNames":["Drug: Colesevelam Hcl"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Colesevelam Hcl","description":"3.75 gm/day (six 675 mg tablets)","armGroupLabels":["Colesevelam arm","Placebo (sugar) pill"],"otherNames":["Welchol"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"The Primary Outcome Will be Improvement in Hepatic Steatosis by Liver MRI","description":"To examine the efficacy of Colesevelam at 3.75 g/day orally versus placebo to decrease liver fat in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Insulin Sensitivity as Determined by HOMA-IR","description":"To examine the efficacy of Colesevelam at 3.75 g/day orally versus placebo to decrease HOMA-IR in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Serum ALT and AST Values","description":"To examine the efficacy of Colesevelam at 3.75 g/day orally versus placebo to decrease serum ALT and AST in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"},{"measure":"Lipid Profiles","description":"To examine the efficacy of Colesevelam at 3.75 g/day orally versus placebo to decrease improve the lipid profiles in patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.","timeFrame":"24 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Thus, subjects with a relatively low BMI can have gross increases in abdominal visceral fat, and others with a high BMI may have very little intra abdominal/visceral fat .\n\nSeveral studies suggested visceral adiposity to be a clinical predictor of hepatic steatosis .\n\nIn addition, the severity of fatty liver has been linked to the VAT area as evaluated by CT."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"MSCT Abdomen","description":"Visceral fat volumetry using MSCT and it's relation to NASH"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"NasH in relation to visceral and subcutaneous fat","description":"Visceral fat volumetryusing MSCT and it'srelation tovisceral andsubcutaneous fat","timeFrame":"base line"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient aged from 18years to 75years of both gender presented to Alrajhi hospital with raised liver enzymes in period from October 2019 to June 2020\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* patient with viral hepatitis History of drug intake Auto immune hepatitis","sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patient from age 18 to 75 years of both gender presented to Assiut University hospital with raised liver enzymes","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Gehad Abd Elaziz Mhmoud","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01005304239","email":"gehadabdelazia@yahoo.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Assiut University","affiliation":"Assiut University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"15181022","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Kershaw EE, Flier JS.

There is currently no FDA approved available treatment for NASH. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential benefit of the medication, pentoxifylline, for the treatment of NASH. The effectiveness of this drug will be determined by taking blood samples and a liver biopsy. To determine if there is any effect of the medication, two-thirds of the patients participating in the study will receive pentoxifylline and one-third will receive placebo (sugar pill). Thus, an individual's chance of receiving the drug is 67%.

It is a non-selective opioid antagonist which has been shown to prevent the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammatory liver injury in a methionine/choline deficient diet fed rat model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In vitro, JKB-121 neutralized or reduced the LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines, deactivated hepatic stellate cells, inhibited hepatic stellate cell proliferation, and collagen expression. Inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway may provide an effective therapy in the prevention of inflammatory hepatic injury and hepatic fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

The results of this study will provide the foundation for future research on the role of VIIT in treating NASH.","detailedDescription":"Background \\& Significance:\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes has prompted a global epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease affecting 15-30% of the general population. Of those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 25% develop NASH and are at increased risk for progressive hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH-related cirrhosis is now the second leading indication of liver transplantation in the United States. For the treatment of NASH, life-style modification with diet and exercise is mandatory. Diet and exercise-induced weight loss \\>5% total body weight improves NASH and reverses hepatic fibrosis, the primary determinant of liver related morbidity and mortality. While weight loss has remained fundamental to disease management it is mistaken as the only assessment for exercise-mediated improvements in NASH. Exercise alone has been shown to improve NASH irrespective of weight loss; however, how exercise works is unclear. Defining an understanding of how exercise effectively treats NASH is an urgent and unmet need that will optimize exercise prescriptions and facilitate identifying candidate therapeutic targets that mimic exercise response for those patients unable to sustain life-style modifications.\n\nOne potential mechanism for exercise improving NASH is through skeletal muscles' signaling proteins, known collectively as myokines. During exercise, myokines are released from skeletal muscle into the circulation where they communicate with several organs, including the liver. Emerging evidence suggests that myokines - particularly myokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) -directly regulates liver interleukin (IL)-8.\n\nOur preliminary data demonstrates that in NASH patients, serum IL-8 is independently associated with hepatic fibrosis and differentially expressed by fibrotic stage. Whether exercise-mediated myokine IL-6 improves NASH-related fibrosis through reductions in IL-8 remains a gap in knowledge.\n\nMyokine IL-6 release into the circulation has been shown to be dependent on the amount of skeletal muscle involved during exercise and level of exercise intensity. Thus, full-body movements performed at high-intensity may release the greatest amounts of myokine IL-6. Vigorous-intensity interval training (VIIT) has not been tested in patients with NASH. Additionally, VIIT in NAFLD has been traditionally performed on a cycle ergometer or treadmill, which greatly limits maximal skeletal muscle utilization during exercise. Since myokine release from skeletal muscle is hypothesized as a critical mechanism of exercise-mediated benefits in NAFLD, the investigators are proposing conducting a feasibility study of a single VIIT session in patients with NASH using an indoor rower. To measure IL-6 myokine response and subsequent changes in serum IL-8 the investigators will collect blood samples prior, immediately after, and 2-hours following a single VIIT session.\n\nDesign \\& Procedures:\n\n12 adults, 18-59 yrs. of age, with NASH-related fibrosis (stage 1-3) will undergo a single VIIT session where blood will be collected prior, immediately following, and 2-hours after exercise:\n\n* Visit 1: The initial visit will take place at the Duke Hepatology Clinic by Dr. Oliver Glass, PhD and Dr. Manal Abdelmalek MD MPH, and will last approximately 30 minutes. We will explain the study and consent form in detail and on an individual basis, and participants will have the opportunity to take the consent home and consider it. If a potential subject decides to consent during this visit, participants will be scheduled for visits 2 and 3. If a potential subject needs more time to consider the consent, participants will have a phone number to call to let study staff know that they wish to move forward with visits 2 and 3, and participants will be consented in person at visit 2 before any study activities take place.\n* Visit 2: This 1-hour visit will take place at the Duke Integrative Medicine. Participants will be instructed on proper form and biomechanics of exercising on an indoor rowing machine. This session will ensure subjects are able to perform indoor rowing properly and safely.\n* Visit 3: Subjects will be fitted with a heart rate monitor around the chest and a baseline 4ml blood sample will be drawn. Vigorous intensity interval training will correspond to heart rate (HR) range of 80-90% of heart rate at age-predicted heart rate maximum (220-age). After approximately 5 minutes of warmup subjects will perform 10 intervals of VIIT: 30 seconds of vigorous intensity exercise followed by 60 seconds of rest. Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) will be rated by 15-point Borg scale; should correspond to HR/10 at end of each interval. The subject will self-adjust the intensity of the exercise bouts and will be encouraged by the researcher to achieve the desired intensity. The exercise session will finish with a short cool-down period and will last no more than 25 minutes in total. A 4ml blood sample will be drawn immediately following the exercise session and 2-hours after exercise cessation.\n\nParticipants may opt-in/opt-out of the option to have their blood samples stored for future research on whether acute exercise alters other myokines besides IL-6 and IL-8. Additionally, future research would evaluate whether acute exercise changes other immune-inflammatory blood biomarkers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)","Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver","Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis","Liver Diseases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"OTHER","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":24,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"VIIT Intervention","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"This is a single-arm trial.

A goal is for a longer term follow up for 5 years to assess the durability of treatment effects and treatment differences.","detailedDescription":"The pilot study proposed in this protocol will determine whether patients with a BMI of 35-50 kg/m2 will consent to liver biopsy, accept randomization to VSG, participate in lifestyle modification for a one-year period and consent to a paired liver biopsy at 12 months. Candidates will be biopsied with 48 randomizations within the first year yielding 20 (including dropouts) participants/group. This should be sufficient to further estimate meaningful differences in liver histology given the estimated weight loss of lifestyle modification with and without VSG and a correlation of percent weight loss and histological score improvement over the short term (12 months). Determining the impact of the VSG is essential for expanding the traditional indications for bariatric surgery and thus, broadening the potential impact of this pilot study.\n\nThe investigators will screen patients by telephone between the ages of 40 and 67 with a self-reported BMI of 35-50 kg/m2, a history of prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. Prospective participants will be asked to provide a copy of their most recent liver chemistries to see if the AST or ALT fall in the inclusion range. The investigators will screen for a history of alcohol or other substance abuse and a surgical history that would preclude a safe VSG. Prospective participants will be invited to attend a seminar. They will be instructed to keep a food and exercise log for two weeks and return for a second visit. After consent is signed, during the eligibility review period participants will have their height and weight recorded, history reviewed, liver function tests, HbA1c, a urine sample, a basic metabolic profile, and INR will be obtained at this time and the participant will be referred for a liver biopsy. If the biopsy is consistent with NASH with a NAS \\>=4, then the participant will undergo MRI assessment and serum markers for inflammation. Vital signs (pulse, temperature, respiration, blood pressure, weight and BMI) will be obtained at each study visit. Participants will then begin an 800 calorie per day diet for 7 days during which they will receive their randomization assignment to VSG or not; all participants will receive lifestyle modification as the investigators need to see if surgery can provide any additional benefit to lifestyle modification. A basic metabolic panel will be performed at the conclusion of the 800 calorie diet. VSG will be performed laparoscopically and the greater curvature resected 6 cm for the pylorus to the angle of His over a 40 French Bougie. Lifestyle modification can begin immediately after surgery, though the VSG participants will not have calorie limits until 6 months after surgery. Participants will be seen regularly by the hepatologist and surgeon at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Lifestyle will be delivered on an individual basis once per week for the first 6 months, twice per month for the next 3 months, and monthly up to one year. Vitamins A, B1, B12 and D and a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver chemistries will be performed at 3 months and 12 months in both groups. At 12 months a repeat liver biopsy will be performed (participants will have the opportunity to select an alternative approach if they did not have a good experience with the initial liver biopsy in order to ensure a paired specimen). This decision will be made in conjunction with the interventional radiologist. MRI for steatosis and elasticity will be performed and serum inflammatory and fibrosis markers will be obtained at 12 months as well as the collection of another urine sample. Participants will exit the study but will continue usual care after 12 months. We will create a biorepository for stool samples to measure the microbiome and for remaining liver tissue to measure the transcriptome.\n\nParticipants meeting study entry criteria are randomized with equal probability to one of two study groups: (1) Lifestyle modification (LSM) or (2) Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG + LSM) with Iifestyle modification, followed for 12 months. The primary goal for the trial is to determine if we can recruit, randomize, and retain participants to perform invasive and non-invasive measurements of NASH and fibrosis, deliver lifestyle modification and demonstrate the safety of VSG.

The national database search in the federal registry of specialized products revealed no registered products for medical nutrition for patients with NAFLD. We developed the composition of specialized food products, produced their experimental batches, and performed laboratory studies of their safety, including tests on toxicology and microbiology (which revealed no concerns). Organoleptic studies of the products showed acceptable results. The aim of the present study is to assess safety and tolerability of newly developed specialized products for medical nutrition of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases in a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.","detailedDescription":"Development of specialized medical products is actual due to the high prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which accounts for 20-30% of the world's population, while non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) accounts for about 20% of all cases of NAFLD and affects all age groups, including children. Currently, there are no generally accepted and efficient methods to treat the disease. Recommended measures include changes in lifestyle, i.e., weight loss and dietary modifications together with increased physical activity. Pragmatic approaches combining dietary restriction and a progressive increase in aerobic exercise / resistance training are preferable and should be individually tailored. Only general principles of diet modification are strongly recommended, though the evidence of their efficacy is far from excellent. According to EASL 2016 guidelines on NAFLD, there is a need for energy restriction, exclusion of NAFLD-promoting components (processed food, and food and beverages high in added fructose; the macronutrient composition should be adjusted according to the Mediterranean diet) and avoidance of excessive alcohol intake. Only limited data are available on the change of diet composition, including the intake of products with low glycaemic index, containing larger amounts of components with known antioxidant capacity (including vitamins and minerals) and dietary fibre. Still, the use of mentioned components is promising in the regard of their potential to trigger metabolic changes, decrease insulin resistance, inflammatory processes in the liver tissue and excessive lipid accumulation in the liver in patients with NAFLD. The database search in the federal registry of specialized products revealed no specialized products for medical nutrition for patients with NAFLD. Despite some similarities in the pathogenesis of the diseases, specialized medical products for patients with diabetes mellitus are not optimal for patients with fatty liver disease. Based on the published data, medical and biological requirements for specialized product of medical nutrition were formulated. According to them, at an earlier stage of the present work we developed the composition of specialized food products, produced their experimental batches, and performed laboratory studies of their safety, including tests on toxicology and microbiology (which revealed no concerns). Organoleptic studies of the products showed acceptable results. The aim of the present study is to assess safety and tolerability of newly developed specialized products for medical nutrition of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases in a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["NAFLD","NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis"],"keywords":["diet","nutrition","specialized food product","medical nutrition products","NAFLD","NASH","steatohepatitis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":45,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Active treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with verified non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, who signed informed consent to participate in the study and are randomly selected to use specialized medical nutrition product together with diet based on the measured individual requirements in energy and protein intake.","interventionNames":["Dietary Supplement: Specialized product for medical nutrition (SPP-1)","Behavioral: individualized diet"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Patients with verified non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, who signed informed consent to participate in the study and are randomly selected to use masked placebo together with diet based on the measured individual requirements in energy and protein intake.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: individualized diet"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT","name":"Specialized product for medical nutrition (SPP-1)","description":"Patients randomly allocated to this group will use specialized product for medical nutrition (SPP-1).

It is more common in the military and Veteran population compared to the general US population. NASH may progress to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, and hence there is critical need for effective treatment. The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether low dose thyroid hormone administered to Veterans diagnosed with NASH can be an effective therapy mediated by improvement in breaking down fat in the mitochondria. The study will be conducted in two stages, the first stage is for proof of concept to be followed by interim analysis. If the interim analysis supports the merit for continuing the study, the clinical trial will proceed to stage 2 for continuation. This study will provide new information and strategies for treatment of NASH using low dose thyroid hormone that will be highly relevant and impactful to the health of the Veteran population.","detailedDescription":"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an aggressive part of the pathological spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that has evolved into a world-wide epidemic and is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States. NASH is strongly linked to obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus and may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Disturbingly, prevalence rates of NASH appear to be greater in the Veteran population compared with the general US population. Thus, the burden of NASH is substantial to Veterans. Despite the recognition of NASH as a major public health problem, only lifestyle modifications aimed at increasing physical activity and reducing caloric intake are currently recommended as treatments with limited success. Thus, there is a great need for effective therapy of NASH. The goal of this study is to test whether low dose thyroid hormone administered to Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH, at a titrated dose (25, 50, or 75 mcg daily) that will maintain thyroid function within normal range (TSH at or above 0.47 mIU/L) can result in histological improvement of NASH, measured by significant reduction in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease score (NAS). The hypothesis is that low dose thyroid hormone causes histological improvement in NASH by increasing mitochondrial FAO in the liver mediated by an increase in mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), the key enzyme in FAO cycle. The preliminary clinical studies in human subjects, including Veterans, support reduced FAO in NASH. In addition, preclinical in vivo animal studies and in vitro cell culture studies support that low dose thyroid hormone can effectively increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and rescue NAFLD. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial, Veterans with normal thyroid levels and biopsy-proven NASH will be recruited and randomized to receive 52 weeks of either active treatment (low dose levothyroxine at 25, 50, or 75 mcg daily) or placebo control to accomplish the following Specific Aims. 1) To determine the efficacy of low dose thyroid hormone in improving NASH histological features. To accomplish this aim, NAS will be measured in pre- and post-liver biopsy samples. 2) To determine the effect of low dose thyroid hormone on mitochondrial FAO, MTP, and mitochondrial health markers in the liver compared to control. To accomplish this aim, mitochondrial FAO and the expression of genes supporting mitochondrial health will be measured in the pre- and post-liver biopsy samples. The primary clinical outcome is histological improvement in NASH measured by improvement in NAS and the secondary clinical outcome is improvement in fibrosis stage. The mechanistic outcomes include improvements in mitochondrial FAO, MTP, and quality markers. This project will be conducted in two stages. In stage 1 (proof-of-concept, 2 years), 32 Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH will be recruited and randomized to either the active treatment or placebo groups (16/group). At the end of the second year, interim analysis will be performed based on criteria that will include conditional power analysis for early efficacy to determine the probability that the full study will yield a statistically significant finding in the primary outcome (histological improvement in NASH) in the clinically relevant direction. Other milestones include trend in the secondary outcome, adverse events, and feasibility. The outcome from the proof-of-concept stage will guide the Go or No-Go decision to stage 2 for continuation of the study with recruitment of additional Veterans for a full 6-year clinical trial (total recruitment of 128 Veterans with biopsy-proven NASH: 64/active treatment group and 64/placebo control group). This project will exert a sustained and powerful impact in the field by providing new information and strategies for treatment of NASH that will be highly relevant and impactful to the health of the Veteran population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis","Liver Fibrosis"],"keywords":["Thyroid hormone","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)","Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Study subjects who are eligible for the study will be assigned by block randomization to either the study group arm receiving active treatment of a titrated dose of Synthroid (25, 50, or 75 mcg/day) or placebo (25, 50, or 75 mcg/day).","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","maskingDescription":"Study subjects will be blinded whether they will receive Synthroid or placebo.
